
Files in this directory are submitted by WoWBench users. They are all "hacks"
that were useful to the authors in working with their own AddOns.

They may or may not be useful for you, and are provided at face value.
Perhaps they can be used as a base for creating a hack of your own, perhaps 
you are lucky and can use one as-is, or perhaps they can inspire you in 
implementing actual WoWBench functionality!
